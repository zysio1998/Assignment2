# Assignment 2

The Spaceship battle is taken from Star Wars

Star Wars Death Star Battle

My idea is to show the batt of the ships Luke Skywalker vs Darth Vader

Lukes ship is in the front and 5 or 3 ships will follow it one being Darth Vader himself and Luke will make the death star explode as in the video.

The camera will follow the battle all the way until Luke fires his ultimate bullet that makes the Death Star explode. once it does the camera will zoom out and show the explosion.
